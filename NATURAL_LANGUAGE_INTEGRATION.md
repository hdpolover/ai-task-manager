- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies important words and concepts from task descriptions
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the emotional tone of task descriptions

### 2. **Enhanced Task Model**
The `TaskItem` model now includes:
```swift
struct TaskItem {
    // ... existing fields ...
    var category: TaskCategory
    var estimatedDuration: TimeInterval
    var keywords: [String]
}
```

### 3. **Smart Task Creation**
The `AddTaskView` now features:
- Real-time AI analysis as you type
- Suggested improvements for priority, category, due date, and duration
- One-click application of AI suggestions
- Visual feedback showing AI analysis results

### 4. **Enhanced Task Display**
The `TaskListView` now shows:
- Task categories with appropriate icons
- Estimated durations
- Rich metadata for better task management

## ðŸ”§ Key Components

Located: `Core/Utils/NaturalLanguageService.swift`
- Main AI processing engine
- Handles all natural language analysis
- Extractable, reusable service

### 2. **Enhanced AddTaskView**
- Real-time AI suggestions
- Smart form pre-filling
- User-friendly AI interaction

### 3. **NLDemoView**
Located: `Features/Tasks/Presentation/NLDemoView.swift`
- Interactive demonstration of AI capabilities
- Sample tasks for testing
- Visual analysis results

### 4. **Updated TaskViewModel**
- Integration with NaturalLanguageService
- Enhanced task creation methods
- Backward compatibility

## ðŸ“± Usage Examples

### Smart Date Recognition
- "Call dentist tomorrow morning" â†’ Sets due date to tomorrow 9:00 AM
- "Meeting next Friday" â†’ Sets due date to next Friday
